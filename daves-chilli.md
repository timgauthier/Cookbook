## Dave's chilli

- one litre beef broth (like the tetra pack things)
- 6-7 medium tomatos, cut into eighths
- one finely diced or shredded carrot
- two whole white onions
- two green bell peppers (if no beans, add one more)
- one red bell pepper (if no beans, double this)
- one cup mushrooms, roughly diced (if no beans, double this)
- about one bulb of garlic, finely diced
- three apples, diced roughly
- one can of corn (not creamed corn)
- one cup maple syrup
- 3 jalapeno peppers
- 3 serrano peppers
- 2 cans of maple baked beans. if these don't exist where you're at, any baked beans will do, but rinse the shit off of them if you can. also use dry beans but I'm lazy as shit.
- 1/2 lb extra lean ground beef or bison
- 1 lb regular ground beef
- black pepper
- chili powder (I prefer chipotle powder)
- frank's (or your favorite sweet and mild sauce) - Optional
- cilantro (optional, if you don't like the taste)
- bay leaf

day before: brown all the beef with some black pepper, and about a tablespoon of chili powder, and 2-3 of the garlic cloves. drain the grease (keep it, though) and store beef in the fridge.

chop the onions, hot, and mild peppers, mushrooms, and the rest of the garlic, and put into a large bowl with a couple splashes of olive oil, a half cup of your hot sauce, a little black pepper, and if you're like me, some cilanro. shake it up and store it in the fridge overnight.

if you're using dry beans, make sure you start soaking them. I'm not an expert on soaking beans but I hear it takes a lot of time, so get this started early.
